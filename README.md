# Lottery Trends Across U.S. Games

## Overview
This project compares number patterns and trends in Powerball, Mega Millions, and Pick 10. It focuses on visual explanations for randomness and fairness rather than trying to predict winning numbers.

## Data
- Historical winning number draws for multiple lottery games

## Tools
- Power BI or Tableau
- Statistical summaries and visualizations: histograms, density plots, scatterplots, small multiples, bubble charts

## Key Questions
- How are winning numbers distributed over time?
- Are there visible patterns that need to be communicated clearly as random?
- How can we improve public understanding of probability?

## Repository Structure
- `code/` – data prep scripts
- `data/` – links or descriptions of draw data sources
- `docs/` – dashboard screenshots and narrative summary
- `results/` – exported charts

## How to Use
View dashboards and visuals in `docs/` and `results/` for interpretation.
